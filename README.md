# PyniverseText
This is my term project for 15-112 at CMU. It is a drawing python text editor with multiple features including auto-indenting, multi-line commenting and indenting, and also its own compiler. It can compile codes that uses simple variables, loop, and recursion. Given more time, I could make this compiler capable of more works.
